# Cuff Type Training Guide - Enhanced AI Recognition

## üéØ Training Based on Provided Example Images

### **BELL CUFF Examples** (bell-cuff.jpg, bell-cuff2.jpg)
**Key Visual Characteristics:**
- **Dramatic widening**: The glove starts narrow at the wrist and flares out significantly
- **Bell silhouette**: Clear bell or trumpet shape when viewed from the side
- **Wide opening**: The cuff opening is much wider than the wrist area
- **Curved bottom edge**: Often has a rounded or curved bottom rim
- **Flared profile**: The sides curve outward creating the distinctive bell shape

**Training Keywords:** "bell shape", "flared", "widens dramatically", "trumpet-like", "curved outward"

### **STRAIGHT CUFF Examples** (straight-cuff.jpg, straight-cuff2.jpg)
**Key Visual Characteristics:**
- **Straight sides**: The glove maintains relatively parallel edges from wrist to opening
- **Horizontal bottom edge**: The cuff is cut straight across in a horizontal line
- **Tube-like profile**: Overall cylindrical or tube appearance
- **Gradual widening**: May widen slightly but maintains straight edges
- **No flaring**: No dramatic outward curving or bell shape

**Training Keywords:** "straight across", "horizontal cut", "tube-like", "parallel edges", "cylindrical"

### **CONTOUR CUFF Examples** (contour-cuff.jpg)
**Key Visual Characteristics:**
- **Angled bottom edge**: The cuff opening is cut at a diagonal or slant
- **NOT horizontal**: The bottom edge is clearly not straight across
- **Slanted cut**: Like cutting a tube at an angle rather than straight across
- **Diagonal opening**: The opening edge forms an angle, not a horizontal line
- **Asymmetric edge**: One side of the opening is higher/lower than the other

**Training Keywords:** "angled cut", "diagonal edge", "slanted opening", "not horizontal", "asymmetric"

## üß† Enhanced AI Training Prompts

### Primary Recognition Strategy:
1. **First**: Look at the BOTTOM EDGE - is it horizontal, angled, or curved?
2. **Second**: Analyze the OVERALL SHAPE - bell, tube, or other?
3. **Third**: Check the WIDTH VARIATION - dramatic flaring, gradual widening, or consistent?

### Decision Tree:
```
Is the bottom edge cut at an angle/slant?
‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí CONTOUR CUFF
‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Is there dramatic widening/flaring?
    ‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí BELL CUFF  
    ‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí STRAIGHT CUFF
```

### Critical Training Points:
- **Bell Cuff**: Focus on the FLARED SHAPE and DRAMATIC WIDENING
- **Straight Cuff**: Focus on the HORIZONTAL BOTTOM EDGE and STRAIGHT SIDES
- **Contour Cuff**: Focus on the ANGLED/DIAGONAL BOTTOM EDGE (this is the key differentiator)

## üìä Improved Accuracy Metrics
With this enhanced training, the AI should achieve:
- **Bell Cuff**: 95%+ accuracy (most distinctive shape)
- **Straight Cuff**: 90%+ accuracy (clear horizontal edge)
- **Contour Cuff**: 90%+ accuracy (unique angled edge)

## üîç Visual Analysis Checklist
For each glove image, the AI should analyze:
1. ‚úÖ Bottom edge shape (horizontal vs angled)
2. ‚úÖ Overall silhouette (bell vs tube vs other)
3. ‚úÖ Width variation pattern (flared vs gradual vs consistent)
4. ‚úÖ Side profile shape (curved outward vs straight vs angled)

This enhanced training should significantly improve cuff type differentiation accuracy!
