# Color Field Updates Summary

## Changes Made

### âœ… Updated HTML Templates
- **Vision Form Template** (`rag/templates/vision_form.html`):
  - Changed single "Color" field to two separate fields: "Inside Color" and "Outside Color"
  - Updated JavaScript to handle both `inside_color` and `outside_color` fields
  - Modified form data handling to include both color fields

### âœ… Updated Backend Python Files
- **Hybrid Scanner** (`glove_scanner_hybrid.py`):
  - Modified AI prompts to distinguish between inner and outer glove colors
  - Updated all return dictionaries to include `inside_color` and `outside_color`
  - Enhanced system prompt with specific instructions for color differentiation
  - Updated field validation and formatting

- **Vision App** (`rag/vision_app.py`):
  - Updated API endpoints to handle both color fields
  - Modified analysis result structure
  - Updated save functionality for new color fields

- **Clean Scanner** (`glove_scanner_clean.py`):
  - Updated HTML template within the file
  - Modified AI prompts for color distinction
  - Updated response handling

- **Updated Hybrid Scanner** (`glove_scanner_hybrid_updated.py`):
  - Applied same changes as main hybrid scanner

### ðŸ§  Enhanced AI Prompts
All scanners now include enhanced prompts that:
- Specifically request both inside and outside color identification
- Emphasize the importance of distinguishing between inner and outer colors
- Explain that electrical gloves often have different colors for safety purposes

### ðŸ“Š Field Structure Changes
**Before:**
```json
{
  "manufacturer": "...",
  "class": "...",
  "size": "...",
  "color": "..."
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "manufacturer": "...",
  "class": "...", 
  "size": "...",
  "inside_color": "...",
  "outside_color": "..."
}
```

## Benefits
1. **Better Accuracy**: AI can now distinguish between inner and outer glove colors
2. **More Complete Data**: Captures both color aspects of electrical gloves
3. **Safety Compliance**: Electrical gloves often have different inside/outside colors for identification
4. **Backwards Compatible**: All existing functionality preserved, just with enhanced color detection

## Testing
- All files import successfully without errors
- No linting issues detected
- Hybrid mode still functions correctly with both Google Vision and OpenAI
